# 🚀 Project Overview

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on key customer attributes.

# The project covers:

Data preprocessing & feature scaling

Machine learning model training

Model serialization using joblib

Deployment using Streamlit Cloud

# 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses.
This application helps businesses predict churn in advance so they can take preventive actions.
